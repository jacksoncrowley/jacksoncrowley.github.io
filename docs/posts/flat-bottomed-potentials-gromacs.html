            <p><p>Flat bottomed potentials (FBPs) are a unique (and powerful) type of restraint we can apply to specific particles in a molecular dynamics simulation. </p>
<p>In short, we define <strong>a fixed geometric region within the simulation box to which certain atoms will either be attracted or repelled</strong>.</p>
<p>They're also a little tricky to understand from a technical perspective.</p>
<p>In this post, I'll briefly discuss the <a href="#the-maths">maths</a>, <a href="#implementation">how to implement</a> an FBP in the <a href="#topology-file">topology</a> and <a href="#restraints-file">restraints</a> files, and finish up with some <a href="#some-practical-notes">practical notes for usage</a>. </p>
<hr />
<h3 id="the-maths">The Maths</h3>
<p>While this is a technical guide, let's have a quick look at the maths behind an FBP, which isn't <em>that</em> terrible, even for a humble biologist such as myself. As we can see from the GROMACS manual, the general equation is given as:
$$
V_{fb}(r_i) = \frac{1}{2}k_{fb}[d_g(r_{i};R_{i}) - r_{fb}]^2 H[d_g(r_{i};R_{i}) - r_{fb}]
$$
with the most important parameters being:
- $d_g(r_{i};R_{I})$, the geometry of the shape we wish to define (FBPs can be spheres, cylinders, or layers, see the <a href="https://manual.gromacs.org/2024.2/reference-manual/functions/restraints.html#flat-bottomed-position-restraints">GROMACS manual</a> for more info on the shapes).
- $r$, the radius of our shape. <strong>A negative radius keeps atoms outside of our FBP region, a positive radius keeps them within</strong>.
- $k$, the force constant applied to the chosen atoms when they are not <strong>inside or outside</strong> of our chosen shape.
- $H$, the Heaviside step function which "turns on" the force constant once a restrained atom leaves the FBP region.</p>
<p>Now, let's have a look at an image from the GROMACS manual:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://manual.gromacs.org/2024.2/_images/fbposres.png" /></p>
<p>Figure A shows a "positive" (non-inverted) FBP, which <strong>keeps a chosen atom within a certain shape</strong>, by applying a force of $k$ if the restrained particle strays outside of the radius $r_{fb}$.</p>
<p>Figure B shows a "negative" (inverted) FBP, which instead <strong>keeps the particle away from the shape</strong>.</p>
<hr />
<h3 id="implementation">Implementation</h3>
<p>Now, what makes FBPs in GROMACS rather annoying from a technical perspective is the need to split the definition across two files:
1. a section in the <code>.itp</code> topology file <strong>defining the shape, radius, force constant</strong>, as well as the specific <strong>atoms to be restrained</strong>.
2. a <code>restraints.gro</code> file which <strong>contains the x, y, and z coordinates</strong> of our FBP region for a given atom</p>
<p>To show how the two work together, let's walk through an example from one of my previous projects (<a href="https://github.com/MoMS-MMSB/lipid_sorting">GitHub</a>, <a href="https://doi.org/10.1016/bs.mie.2024.03.022">Publication</a>), in which we use FBPs to define a pore region in a coarse-grained (Martini 3) membrane tubule, to stop lipids from passing through the pore.</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://github.com/MoMS-MMSB/lipid_sorting/blob/main/figures/Renders/POPC_POPE_r10_l10_pore/x_110_5deg_dof_notrj.gif?raw=true" />
<center><i> A POPC/POPE membrane tubule with pores in the x- and y- dimensions </i></center></p>
<hr />
<h4 id="topology-file">Topology File</h4>
<p>To make these pores, I wanted two cylindrical FBPs crossing the box, one in x, one in y. By defining a negative radius of -2.5nm, I'm keeping the restrained molecules out of the FBP geometries. And I wanted a strong force constant, k=5000 (where k=$KJ \cdot mol^{-1}\cdot nm^{-2}$). </p>
<p>I define all of these in the <strong>itp file for the molecule I want to restrain</strong> (here, my coarse-grained phospholipid).</p>

<p>The atom number within the molecule I'm restraining. </p>

<p>The function type: here, we put a 2 for all entries, which is the function type for FBPs under the <code>[position_restraints]</code> directive.</p>
</li>

<p>The shape (g) of the FBP. Here, I'm using <code>6</code> for a cylinder spanning the x-dimension, and <code>7</code> for a cylinder spanning the y-dimension.</p>

<p>The radius $r$ of the FBP.</p>
</li>

<p>The force constant $k$.</p>

<p>This is a nice example, as we can see that we can define multiple FBPs on the same particle.</p>

<h4 id="restraints-file">Restraints File</h4>
<p>However, you may notice that we haven't yet centered the FBP anywhere! This is where the <code>restraints.gro</code> file comes in.</p>
<p>A snippet from my <code>restraints.gro</code> file looks like this:</p>

<p>Since I'm <strong>restraining the POPC</strong> lipids, I define the FBP center of geometry on the POPC particles/atoms as x,y,z in the gro file coordinates. </p>
<p>Since I'm <strong>not restraining the water (W)</strong> molecules, they can simply be left as is.</p>
<p>On my <a href="https://gist.github.com/jacksoncrowley/cdb4dffaefd14edd2a44f12b54e45b83">github</a> I have a script that will take care of this, which would generate a restraints file from your starting structure file, which would be run as:</p>
<p><code>python gen_gromacs_restraints.py -c $INPUT_GRO -r POPC -r POPE -x 14.799 -y 14.799 -z 5</code></p>

<h3 id="some-practical-notes">Some practical notes</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>A given particle can have multiple FBPs placed upon it, but they all must come from the same set of coordinates</strong> as found in the <code>restraints.gro</code>. </li>
<li><strong>A poorly placed flat-bottomed potential will probably cause your system to explode immediately</strong>. If a system suddenly has a force of 5000 kJ/mol/nm^2 applied to every molecule in a given region, don't expect it to respond kindly. </li>
<li>As such, be <strong>generous with the radius</strong> and <strong>soft with the force constant</strong>, at least at first. It may be a good practice to "grow" your FBP by gradually increasing $r$ and $k$ over a few subsequent simulations. Be kind to your simulations!</li>
<li>You can check the <code>.log</code> file to make sure your FBP is actually running; there should be an entry <code>Flat-b. P-R.</code>. If it shows a 0.00000, this means that no particles are currently being affected by the FBPs.</li>
<li><strong>If an FBP has been defined in the topology, it will not run without a restraints.gro</strong> file, which is flagged at the <code>gmx grompp</code> step with <code>-r</code>. If you're not sure if you've got it working properly, try <code>grompp</code>-ing without <code>-r</code>.</li>
